     @class Mcp4725::Private
     @brief Private implementation class for Mcp4725.

     This class provides the private implementation for the Mcp4725 device, inheriting from Converter::Private.
     It manages the communication with the MAX7311 I2C I/O expander, providing methods for opening, closing,
     reading, writing, and configuring the device. The class supports multiple channels and exposes device-specific
     properties such as resolution, range, and operational modes.

     @note This class is intended for internal use within the Mcp4725 implementation and should not be used directly.
