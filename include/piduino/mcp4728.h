     @class Mcp4728
     @brief Class for the MCP4728 series of digital-to-analog converters.

     The MCP4728 is a 12-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with an I2C interface.
     It allows for easy integration into microcontroller projects and provides a simple way to generate analog voltages.
     The reference voltage is equal to the supply voltage (VDD), which is typically 3.3V or 5V (3.3V on Pi boards).
     An EEPROM can be enabled to store the DAC's value.

     The parameters for the constructor registered are:
     - `bus=id` : The I2C bus ID (default is I2cDev::defaultBus().id(), use pinfo to get the default bus ID).
     - `addr={0x60...0x67}` : The I2C address of the converter (default is 0x60).
     - `ref={vdd,int}` : The reference voltage setting (default is vdd).
     - `fsr=value` : The full-scale range value. (default is 3.3V)
     - `gain={1,2}` : The gain setting (default is 1).
     - `mode={norm,fast,eeprom,pd1k,pd100k,pd500k}` : The mode setting (default is norm). See the MCP4728 datasheet for more information.
