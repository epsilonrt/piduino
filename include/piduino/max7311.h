     @brief I2C GPIO expander controller for the MAX7311 device.

     The MAX7311 is a 16-port I2C GPIO expander that provides additional digital I/O pins
     for microcontroller systems. This class provides a high-level interface for configuring
     and controlling the MAX7311 device, including pin mode setting, digital read/write
     operations, and bus timeout management.

     The device supports addresses from 0x20 to 0xDE and operates on standard I2C buses.
     Each of the 16 ports can be individually configured as input or output with optional
     polarity inversion and interrupt generation capabilities.
