  /**
   * @class SerialPort
   * @brief Provides functions to access serial ports.

      You can get information about the available serial ports using the
      SerialPort::Info helper class, which allows an enumeration of all the serial
      ports in the system. This is useful to obtain the correct name of the
      serial port you want to use. You can pass an object
      of the helper class as an argument to the setPort() or setPortName()
      methods to assign the desired serial device.

      After setting the port, you can open it in read-only (r/o), write-only
      (w/o), or read-write (r/w) mode using the open() method.

      @note The serial port is always opened with exclusive access
      (that is, no other process or thread can access an already opened serial port).

      Use the close() method to close the port and cancel the I/O operations.

      Having successfully opened, SerialPort tries to determine the current
      configuration of the port and initializes itself. You can reconfigure the
      port to the desired setting using the setBaudRate(), setDataBits(),
      setParity(), setStopBits(), and setFlowControl() methods.

      There are a couple of properties to work with the pinout signals namely:
      SerialPort::dataTerminalReady, SerialPort::requestToSend. It is also
      possible to use the pinoutSignals() method to query the current pinout
      signals set.

      Once you know that the ports are ready to read or write, you can
      use the read() or write() methods.

      SerialPort provides a set of functions that suspend the
      calling thread until certain signals are emitted. These functions
      can be used to implement blocking serial ports:

      @list

      @li waitForReadyRead() blocks calls until new data is available for
      reading.

      @li waitForBytesWritten() blocks calls until one payload of data has
      been written to the serial port.
