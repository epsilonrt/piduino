     @class Mcp4725
     @brief Class for the MCP4725 series of digital-to-analog converters.

     The MCP4725 is a 12-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with an I2C interface.
     It allows for easy integration into microcontroller projects and provides a simple way to generate analog voltages.
     The reference voltage is equal to the supply voltage (VDD), which is typically 3.3V or 5V (3.3V on Pi boards).
     An EEPROM can be enabled to store the DAC's value.

     The parameters for the constructor registered are:
     - `bus=id` : The I2C bus ID (default is I2cDev::defaultBus().id(), use pinfo to get the default bus ID).
     - `addr={0x60...0x67}` : The I2C address of the converter (default is 0x60).
     - `fsr=value` : The full-scale range value. (default is 3.3V)
     - `mode={norm,fast,eeprom,pd1k,pd100k,pd500k}` : The mode setting (default is norm). See the MCP4725 datasheet for more information.
