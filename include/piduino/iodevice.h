       * do not support seeking. You can only read from the device when it
       * reports that data is available. The most common example of a sequential
       * device is a network socket. On Unix, special files such as /dev/zero
       * and fifo pipes are sequential.
       *
       * Regular files, on the other hand, do support random access. They have
       * both a size and a current position, and they also support seeking
       * backwards and forwards in the data stream. Regular files are non-sequential.
