    @class SoftPwm
    @brief Software-based PWM implementation for Piduino.

    The SoftPwm class provides a software-driven Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) interface
    for controlling the duty cycle and frequency of a digital output pin. It inherits from
    the Pwm base class and allows flexible configuration of PWM parameters such as range
    and frequency. This class is useful for platforms where hardware PWM is not available
    or when additional PWM channels are required.

    @note The minimum tick value is set to 10 microseconds, which determines the smallest
    time unit for PWM period calculation (range * tick = period in microseconds).

    @see Converter
