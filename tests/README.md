# Piduino tests

This directory contains tests for Piduino. The tests are designed to ensure that the Piduino library functions correctly and that the hardware behaves as expected.

We use the [`UnitTest++`  framework](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/wiki)  for writing and CTest for running the tests. The tests are written in C++ and can be run on any platform that supports the Piduino library.
